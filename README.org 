* Preflop Advisor based on Monker

** Description
Preflop Advisor is a Python-based tool designed to read frequencies and EVs from PLO and PLO8 Monker preflop simulations for a given hand.
The idea is to export all of your Monker Preflop Trees and get a very fast action and EV profile of a given hand for different stack sizes, ante structures and number of players without loading the full preflop tree in MonkerSolver and clicking through long action sequences.
While the tool generally supports No Limit (NL), it is currently not functional out of the box for NL. (Hand based view makes also no sense for NL)
PLO 5-Card is generally also supported but probably not relevant for most players since Moker Solver 5-card is not available publicly.
This tool was written for Moker Solver version 1. Monker Solver version 2. exports hands slightly differently and therefore need some preprocessing.
See Usage for detailed Information. Preflopranges are not uploaded to this repository (only 100bb HU for demonstration) - you have to setup and run your preflop simulations on your own or buy it.

** Features
    - Concise PLO hand profile for most common preflop actions for all your Monker preflop trees.
    - Supports multiple (indefinite) preflop strategy trees
    - Displays frequencies and corresponding EVs to make it easier to evaluate handstrength against opponents who dont play GTO preflop strategy.
    - Tooltips in order to get a quick overview of the general frequencies and strategies for a given tree.

* Installation Guide
** Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You can download it from [[https://www.python.org/downloads/][python.org]]. On Windows, make sure to select "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

** Installation Steps

1. Download the Repository:
   - Clone the repository or go to the [[https://github.com/ksoeze/PreflopAdvisor][PreflopAdvisor GitHub page]].
   - Click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".
   - Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

2. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:
   - On Windows: Press =Win + R=, type =cmd=, and press Enter.
   - On Linux: Open your preferred terminal emulator.

3. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   cd path\to\PreflopAdvisor
   #+END_SRC

4. Install the Required Dependencies:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   #+END_SRC

5. Export your Monker Preflop trees:
   For every tree:
   - Open the Tree in Monker
   - Right Click in Range Window -> Export preflop for MonkerViewer
   - The exported Ranges are in the Monker Solver folder -> ranges
     move it to another location and/or give it a more descriptive name if you plan to export many trees.
   - For Monker Solver 2 only:
     open hand_convert_helper.py
     in def test() at the bottom:
     edit the path in replace_all_monker_2_files("/home/johann/monker-beta/ranges/Omaha5/6-way/100bb/")
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     python hand_convert_helper.py
     #+END_SRC
     this can take a few minutes
6. Configure the Tool:
   - Open =preflop_advisor/config.ini= in a text editor (e.g., Notepad, nano, vim).
   - Edit the configuration sections as needed:
     - [TreeSelector]: Set NumTrees to the number of trees you are using.
     - [TreeInfos]: make an entry for each tree:
       + Table12=2,100,PLO,/home/johann/monker-1/ranges/Omaha/HU/100bb/,   no Rake
         this is an example for the 100bb HU tree - every entry has to be there.
         Name=Number of Players,Stacksize in BB, GAME, FULL path to the range folder, Rake setting
     - [TreeToolTips]: Add tooltips for each tree, if desired. Ensure the number of tooltips matches the number of trees.
       I generated the tooltip infos programmatically using functions in frequency_reader_helper.py
       For technical users read there and try to figure it output.
       Otherwise generate a Popup by hand or use one of mine from the popup-pics folder if it fits.
       Tooltips are optional -> you can disable them setting
       ToolTips=NO
7. (Optional) Adjust Font Sizes for High-Resolution Monitors:
   - CardSelector Font: In =card_selector.py=, update =BUTTON_FONT=.
   - TreeSelector Font: In =config.ini= under [TreeSelector], update =FontSize=.
   - PositionSelector Font: In =config.ini= under [PositionSelector], update =FontSize=.
   - Output Font: In =output_objects.py=, update =RESULT_FONT=.

* Usage

#+begin_src sh
python standalone.py
#+end_src


** Interface Description

*** Top Left: Card Selector
Select the desired hand. If you select another card while four cards are already selected, it will start over with a new hand. Clicking on a selected card will unselect it.

*** Bottom Left: Tree Selector
Displays the list of available trees as configured in =config.ini=. Tooltips provide additional information if configured. Selecting a different tree updates the output for the currently selected hand.

*** Top Middle: Position Selector
The default position is "X" for an overview of all positions. Selecting a specific position shows detailed information about that position's strategies, including 4bet and squeeze spots.

*** Top Right: Output Grid
Top line shows Hand, Position and general Information about the currently selected Tree
**** General Overview (Position = X)
First column shows available positions.
Second column the first in action. For positions other then SB it asumes the there is only openraise possible.
For Example UTG FI for this hand shows:
- 1 Line Raise100 (meaning potopen...it shows the descrition for the sizing given in config.ini)
- 2 Line 0 (Shows the frequency suggested by monker; If the frequency is over 50% the item is has lighter background for better visibility)
- 3 Line -0.14 (EV estimate by monker in BIG BLINDS (changed that from default monker milli-sb because I am more used to it))
also in contrast to monker interface it shows relative EVs (when facing for example a 3-bet it shows ev compared to folding at this point and not overall ev from the start)
Other column shows infos vs positions -> if position in top line comes before our position it shows action us facing an openraise. Left item is
call, right item is 3bet. Otherwise we open and face a 3bet from the other position (left item call 3bet; right item 4bet)
Small Blind has option to openlimp. If your tree only thas open or fold strategy you get an error message in the terminal output which can be
ignored. It then just shows the raise item. SB vs BB entry shows action after we openraise. For action after we openlimp and BB raises see SB position view.
*** Position Overview
- First result line is equal to the corresponding result line from default view.
- Squeeze: Gives the action for column position opens and player right next to him coldcalls and it folds to us where we can call/squeeze.
So it is the "tightest" of the squeeze spots possible vs this opener. Again if there is no 2nd overcall in the tree it writes error message to terminal.
- 4bet: If column position is before is it asumes an open from the player before him, he 3bets and we have the option to cold4bet. Otherwise it
shows standard we open and face a 3bet from the other position.
- vs 4bet: same idea. position before us means we face 4bet from opener after we 3bet him and otherwise we face cold4bet after we 3bet player right before us.
- vs squeeze: we open and player right next to us flatts and we then face the squeeze from the column position (classic sandwich spot)
